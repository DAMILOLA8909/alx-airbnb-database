# üß† Advanced SQL Joins ‚Äì Airbnb Database Script

This project demonstrates the use of **different SQL JOIN operations** as part of the **Advanced SQL: Complex Queries, Indexing, and Optimization** module.

It includes:
- Table creation scripts  
- Sample data inserts  
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN examples  

---

## üéØ Objective
Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using:
- **INNER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve related records across tables  
- **LEFT JOIN** ‚Üí Include unmatched records from the left table  
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve all records from both tables  

---

## üß© Database Schema

| Table | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `users` | Stores user information |
| `properties` | Contains property listings |
| `bookings` | Links users to properties through reservations |
| `reviews` | Contains user reviews for properties |

---

## üßæ Queries Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN
**Goal:** Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

```sql
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
INNER JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
This query only returns records where there is a matching user_id in both users and bookings.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

Goal: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

```sql
SELECT 
    properties.property_id,
    properties.name AS property_name,
    reviews.review_id,
    reviews.rating,
    reviews.comment
FROM 
    properties
LEFT JOIN 
    reviews 
ON 
    properties.property_id = reviews.property_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
This query returns all properties, even if they don‚Äôt have a review.
If a property has no review, the review_id, rating, and comment will be NULL.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN

Goal: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

```sql
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id

UNION

SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
RIGHT JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
Since MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN, this query uses a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION to simulate the same behavior.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Make sure your MySQL server is running.

2. Create and select your database:
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p
CREATE DATABASE airbnb_db;
USE airbnb_db;
```
3. Execute the script::
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p airbnb_db < database-adv-script/joins_queries.sql
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end of this task, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs

- Retrieve relational data from multiple tables

- Write clean, efficient, and testable SQL join queries

- Analyze how different joins affect result sets

# üß† SQL Subqueries ‚Äì Airbnb Database Script

This project demonstrates how to use **subqueries** in SQL to retrieve data based on conditions from other queries.  
It includes both **correlated** and **non-correlated** examples.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Write a query using a non-correlated subquery to find properties with average ratings greater than 4.0  
- Write a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings  

---

## üß© Queries Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Correlated Subquery
**Goal:** Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0  

```sql
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location
FROM 
    properties p
WHERE 
    p.property_id IN (
        SELECT 
            r.property_id
        FROM 
            reviews r
        GROUP BY 
            r.property_id
        HAVING 
            AVG(r.rating) > 4.0
    );
```
#### üìò Explanation:
The inner query calculates the average rating for each property.
The outer query then selects only those properties whose average rating exceeds 4.0.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlated Subquery

Goal: Find users who have made more than 3 bookings

```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    u.email
FROM 
    users u
WHERE 
    (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*)
        FROM 
            bookings b
        WHERE 
            b.user_id = u.user_id
    ) > 3;
```
üìò Explanation:
Here, the inner query is correlated with the outer one because it depends on each specific user (u.user_id).
It counts how many bookings each user has made and returns those with more than 3.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

In your terminal:
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p airbnb_db < database-adv-script/subqueries.sql
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understand the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries

- Write efficient nested queries for complex data filtering

- Perform aggregate-based filtering using subqueries

# üìä SQL Aggregation and Window Functions ‚Äì Airbnb Database Script

This module demonstrates how to use **aggregation** and **window functions** in SQL  
to analyze user and property booking data effectively.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Count total bookings made by each user using `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY`
- Use window functions (`RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`) to rank and number properties based on booking volume

---

## üßÆ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation Query
**Goal:** Find total number of bookings made by each user  

```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM 
    users u
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings b
ON 
    u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY 
    u.user_id, u.name
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC;
```
#### üìò Explanation:
- Counts all bookings made by each user.
- LEFT JOIN ensures even users with no bookings are included.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Window Function Query ‚Äì Using RANK()

Goal: Rank properties by number of bookings
```sql
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS property_rank
FROM 
    properties p
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings b
ON 
    p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC;
```
#### üìò Explanation:

- RANK() assigns a position based on total bookings.

- If two properties have the same count, they share the same rank.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Window Function Query ‚Äì Using ROW_NUMBER()

Goal: Assign unique sequential numbers to each property
```sql
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS property_row_number
FROM 
    properties p
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings b
ON 
    p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC;
```

#### üìò Explanation:

- ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique number to each row, even if booking totals tie.

- Ideal for pagination or sequential data analysis.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p airbnb_db < database-adv-script/aggregations_and_window_functions.sql
```

---

### üß™ Sample Data Demonstration

Run:
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p airbnb_db < database-adv-script/aggregations_and_window_functions.sql
```

| user_name     | total_bookings |

| David Brown   | 3              |
| Brian Smith   | 3              |
| Cynthia Lee   | 3              |
| Alice Johnson | 2              |

| City Center Loft     | 3              | 1             | 2                   |
| Beach Villa          | 3              | 1             | 3                   |
| Mountain Cabin       | 2              | 4             | 4                   |
| Country House        | 1              | 5             | 5                   |


### ‚úÖ Expected Learning Outcomes

- Summarize data using COUNT() and GROUP BY

- Analyze datasets using RANK() and ROW_NUMBER()

- Understand how window functions differ from regular aggregations

- Write analytical queries that power reporting dashboards
